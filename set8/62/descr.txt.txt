Exercise 62

Design a program that compiles a list of sourde files concurrently, using all the cores your computer has.
If a compilation fails, then running compilations may end and sources waiting to be compiled are not considered. 
Once a compilation fails only the error-output of that compilation must be shown.

Your program should also offer an option allowing users to specify the number of compilation threads to use. 
The minimum number of compilation threads must be 1: if 0 is specified, 1 is silently used. 
Another option specifies a directory where temporary files are stored. This directory may not yet exist, and must be removed when the program ends.
