If we run multiple threads for which we want to be checking if they request the program to end,
we would add a vector of shared_futures each thread would return its value to one of the entries 
of the vector. Then we would add one more thread, checking, that would take as argument the 
reference to the vector of shared futures and check in a loop each future if it had returned and 
if it requested the end of the program. Once a future had returned with "end the program", checking
would return similarly to a future that would be checked by the main thread the same way it is checked
on the single thread example.
