Exercise 19
*Explain why, when Derived is derived from Base the Base class is constructed
 first before the Derived class and the Base class is destroyed only after
 the Derived class.

Since the Derived class inherits from the Base class, the compiler
constructs Base first as the Derived class may rely on objects constructed
from Base. Not doing so could lead to undefined behavior. Similarly, the
compiler destructs the Derived class first as the Base class may contain
data or functions that Derived needs to properly cleanup.

*Provide a small example that would completely fail if the order were
 reversed.
