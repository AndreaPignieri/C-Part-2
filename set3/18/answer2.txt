*Show what happens if you call each of Derived's constructors, explain.

The output from running main.cc is as follows

Output:

Calling Derived Default:
Base: Default Constructor.
Calling Derived Copy:
Base: Default Constructor.
Calling Derived Move:
Base: Default Constructor.


Clearly the default Base constructor is called everytime a Derived
constructor is called. This is as expected, unless explicitly stated,
when inherited class objects are constructed the default base 
constructor is called first and the derived constructor is called 
after.
