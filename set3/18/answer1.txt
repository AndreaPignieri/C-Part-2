Exercise 18
*Design a class Base and a class Derived which inherits from Base,
 both classes have a Default, Copy and Move constructor.
 
*Change Derived's constructors so that they call the matching
 Base constructor.
  
*How could you get Derived's copy constructor to call
 Base's move, and vice versa?
