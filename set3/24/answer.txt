When implementing the Derived constructor we need to make sure that the Base 
constructor is called. To do that we create a data member for derived of type 
fstream. It can't be declared in the constructor, since it'll be destroyed
at the end of the constructor and Base has a data member that is a reference 
to an ostream. Using the Base constructor we initialise the data member of Base
to be reference of the uninitialised member of Derived. Only after Base is
contructed we initialise out pointing to the file "name", thus finishing the
construction of derived.
