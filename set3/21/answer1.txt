There are many reasons that classify the usage of the class std::string as bad
practise.

- std::string can get changed resulting to a change on the derived class too, 
which would later require modifications.

- std::string doesn't have virtual destructors, if a string pointer to derived 
was deleted the derived object would not be deleted properly and a leak might
happen.

-Finally, std::string represents a type, with inheritance we attempt to represent
the relation of is-a. In the case of string a has-a relation is more likely and 
has more advantages.

For the above reasons composition is always preferred to inheritance.
