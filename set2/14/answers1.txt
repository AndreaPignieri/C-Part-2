Exercise 14

Complete the incomplete class TempFIle which represents a temporary file.
Use the class along with implemented programs to demonstrate the following:
* A local TempFile removes itself from the filesystem when it goes
  out of scope.
* When an unrelated exception is thrown and caught, files arent leaked.
* If the exception is not caught then the destructor is not called.
(Note later on in the question the additional option of converting
 to an fstream object is implemented, this is included in the class here)
