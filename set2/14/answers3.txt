The output from "dontcatch2.cc" shows the same as
"dontcatch.cc" however when we examine the file directory
"XXXXXXXX.tmp" is not there. This shows that even if
the programmer does not catch the exception, an fstream wont
leak a file into the system.

*What is your rule of thumb for writing or not writing
 catch clauses in your programs?
 
We use the 1:1 rule, i.e. for every try block there should
be a 1:1 correspondence between a potential failure of the
code or exception and a meaningful, specified recovery 
action. If there is no meaningful recovery action then
the exception should be dealt with at a more general level
with a cath (...).

*What is your rule of thumb for pointers-to-dynamically
 -allocated-memory and other variables that hold acquired 
 resources?
 
The rule we try to follow for this is to avoid global variables
for resource management wherever possible. Using local variables
restricts the lifetime of allocated memory to the smallest
necessary range and allows for easier cleanup. As for using
class data members, we do this when the resource is that 
class's responsibility and the memory can be cleaned by the 
class or destructor.
