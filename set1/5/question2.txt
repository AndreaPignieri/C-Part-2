The operator << takes two arguments, the one on the left-hand side will be
part of a namespace nms. Because of the Koenig lookup the compiler  calls the 
nms::operator<<(). For example:

std::cout << "Hello";

One of the arguments is cout which belongs to the namespace std, so 
std::operator<< is called, without the need to write

std::operator<<(cout, "hello");

which isn't as easy to read.
