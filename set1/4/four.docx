The issue with the code arises from the following line in the promptGet function:
return getline(in, str);
What happens is a return type mismatch, as the getline function returns an input stream reference, not a bool, thus the istream reference cannot be implicitly converted to a bool. To fix the code we can either modify the function body to look like this:
bool promptGet(istream &in, string &str)
{
    cout << "Enter a line or ^D\n"; // ^D signals end-of-input
    return static_cast<bool>(getline(in, str));
}
Like this, the returned istream is converted to a bool, which checks the validity of the stream.
Another option would be to modify the function signature:
istream &promptGet(istream &in, string &str)
{
    cout << "Enter a line or ^D\n"; // ^D signals end-of-input
    return getline(in, str);
}
Now, the return type of promptGet is istream&, matching the return type of getline.
