This program implements a basic Strings class, which stores a dynamic collection of strings. It provides functions to:
Initialize the collection from command-line arguments or an environment-like array.
Add new strings to the collection.
Access individual strings with bounds checking.

The program handles dynamic memory allocation and deallocation to avoid memory leaks. The implementation supports accessing and modifying strings by index, with distinct functions for const and non-const access. The focus is on simplicity and correctness without advanced features like reference counting or copy-on-write.
